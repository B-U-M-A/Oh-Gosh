## Key Features

- **Intuitive Player Control:** Move Juan Becerra horizontally and vertically with keyboard (WASD/Arrow Keys) on desktop or an on-screen virtual joystick on mobile.
- **Dynamic Enemy AI:** "C" enemies continuously pursue Juan Becerra, with their speed and numbers increasing over time for escalating challenge.
- **Collision-based Game Over:** The game ends upon any collision between Juan Becerra and a "C", leading to a clear "Game Over" state.
- **Comprehensive Game State Management:** Handles transitions between start screen, active gameplay, and game over, with options to restart.
- **Immersive Visuals & Audio:** Enjoy a consistent pixel art style with smooth animations, complemented by distinct sound effects for key events and looping background music.
- **High Score Tracking:** Continuously tracks and displays survival time, records high scores, and persists them locally across browser sessions.
- **In-game Tutorial:** A brief, non-intrusive tutorial explains controls and objectives upon first launch.
- **Pause Functionality:** Temporarily halt and resume gameplay with a dedicated input, displaying a "Game Paused" overlay.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

The objective is simple: **evade the "C"s for as long as possible!**

- **Movement (Desktop):** Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys or the `Arrow Keys` to move Juan Becerra.
- **Movement (Mobile):** Use the on-screen virtual joystick located in the bottom-left corner. TODO
- **Pause Game:** Press the `P` key (desktop) or click the designated pause button (if available on UI) during gameplay.

Survive longer to achieve a higher score!
