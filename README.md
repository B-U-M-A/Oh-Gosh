- **Minimap:** A configurable minimap helps players navigate the expansive game world.

## Gameplay Overview

In "Oh-Gosh," your primary objective is to **evade the relentless "C" enemies for as long as possible!** Control Juan Becerra in a top-down, procedurally generated world. As time progresses, the challenge intensifies with faster and more numerous enemies. Survive to achieve the highest score and aim to reach the ultimate win condition by outlasting the clock!

## Controls

The objective is simple: **evade the "C"s for as long as possible!**

- **Movement (Desktop):** Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys or the `Arrow Keys` to move Juan Becerra.
- **Pause Game:** Press the `P` key or `ESC` key during gameplay to pause/unpause.
- **Menu Navigation:** Use `Arrow Keys` to navigate menu options and `ENTER` or `SPACE` to select.

Survive longer to achieve a higher score!

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The core programming language for the game logic.
- **Phaser.io:** A powerful, open-source HTML5 game framework (version 3.90.0 or later) for building browser-based games.
- **HTML5 Canvas & WebGL:** Utilized by Phaser.io for rendering game elements.
- **TypeScript:** For enhanced code quality, maintainability, and type safety.
- **Vite:** A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **React:** Used for the main application shell (`App.tsx`) that embeds the Phaser game.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup (For Local Development)

To run "Oh-Gosh" locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/B-U-M-A/Oh-Gosh.git
    cd Oh-Gosh
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Phaser.io and other dependencies managed via npm.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start a local development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

4.  **Build for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command compiles the project into the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

## Future Enhancements
