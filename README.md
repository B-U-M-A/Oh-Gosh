# Oh Gosh

Oh Gosh is an arcade-style, single-player, browser-based video game where players control the character "Juan Becerra" with the objective of escaping from multiple pursuing entities referred to as "C"s. Featuring a distinct pixel art aesthetic, the game focuses on evasion and survival, offering an engaging and challenging experience directly within your web browser.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup (For Local Development)

To run "Juan Becerra's Escape Game" locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd juan-becerra-escape-game
    ```

    (Replace `[repository-url]` with the actual URL of the game's repository.)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Phaser.io, which can often be included directly or managed via a package manager. If `package.json` is present, you might need to run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start a local server:**
    Since this is a browser-based game, you'll need a local web server to serve the HTML, JavaScript, and assets. You can use tools like `http-server` (Node.js) or Python's built-in server:

    - **Using `http-server` (Node.js):**
      ```bash
      npm install -g http-server
      http-server .
      ```
    - **Using Python 3:**
      ```bash
      python -m http.server
      ```

4.  **Open in browser:**
    After starting the server, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port indicated by your server).
